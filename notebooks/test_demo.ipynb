      "🧠 Step 3: The inflation rate in Kenya for 2023 was **7.9% in April 2023** and rose to **8.0% in May 2023**, as reported by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The rise in inflation is primarily attributed to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages (10.1%–10.2% annual increase):** Driven by supply chain disruptions, climate-related impacts on agriculture, and rising global commodity prices.  \n",
      "2. **Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas, and Fuels (9.6%–9.7% annual increase):** Higher energy costs, particularly electricity tariffs, and construction material prices.  \n",
      "3. **Transport (9.8%–10.1% annual increase):** Increased fuel prices and transportation costs due to global oil price fluctuations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These categories account for over 57% of the CPI's weighted components, amplifying their impact on overall inflation. Additionally, monthly CPI increases (e.g., a 0.9% rise from April to May 2023) were driven by marginal but cumulative price hikes in essential goods and services.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Answer:** Kenya’s 2023 inflation rate was approximately **7.9–8.0%**, driven by rising food, energy, and transport costs linked to global price trends, local supply constraints, and energy policy adjustments.\n",
