      "\n",
      "### 1. **Persistent Trade Deficits**  \n",
      "   - **Foreign Trade Data**: The *foreign_trade_summary* table reveals consistent negative trade balances (e.g., large deficits in 2022–2023). Kenya imports significantly more goods (e.g., machinery, fuel, and manufactured products) than it exports, increasing demand for foreign currency and weakening the shilling.  \n",
      "   - **Impact**: A trade deficit reduces foreign exchange reserves, making the currency more vulnerable to depreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Low Central Bank Intervention**  \n",
      "   - **CBK Policy**: News articles highlight the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has limited interventions in the foreign exchange market. Without active measures to stabilize the shilling (e.g., selling foreign reserves), market forces drive the currency lower.  \n",
      "   - **Market Sentiment**: Analysts predict the shilling could fall below **KES 90 to the dollar** by year-end, reflecting weak confidence in sustained CBK support.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Low Interest Rates**  \n",
      "   - **Monetary Policy (Table 16)**: Savings deposit rates (e.g., 3.56% in 2022) and inter-bank rates (5.39% in 2022) are historically low, reducing incentives for foreign investors to hold shillings. This drives capital outflows, further pressuring the currency.  \n",
      "   - **Comparison**: Overdraft and loan rates (12–12.67%) remain high for borrowers but fail to attract external investment, as returns in shillings are eroded by depreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Weak Export Sector Growth**  \n",
      "   - **Agriculture Data (Table 33)**: While tea and pyrethrum production has grown, key exports like maize and wheat show volatility. Agriculture contributes ~21% of GDP but lacks diversification or value addition to boost export earnings.  \n",
      "   - **Non-Agricultural Exports**: Limited growth in manufacturing and services (e.g., tourism) exacerbates the trade deficit, reducing foreign exchange inflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Global and Regional Factors**  \n",
      "   - **Commodity Prices**: Higher global fuel and food prices increase import costs, worsening the trade deficit.  \n",
      "   - **Regional Currency Dynamics**: The shilling’s depreciation relative to neighbors (e.g., Uganda, Tanzania) reflects broader East African economic challenges, including inflation and weak regional trade integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion  \n",
      "The shilling’s depreciation stems from structural issues: **trade imbalances**, **limited CBK intervention**, **low interest rates**, and **stagnant export growth**. Without addressing these fundamentals (e.g., boosting exports, attracting foreign investment, or stabilizing the exchange rate), the shilling is likely to remain under pressure. Policymakers must balance short-term market interventions with long-term structural reforms to restore currency stability.\n",
