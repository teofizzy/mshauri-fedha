      "📝 Excerpt: In Kenya, a significant backlash has emerged against the 2024 Finance Bill, which proposes various tax increases. The bill was approved by the Kenyan parliament. This happened despite modifications by Parliament’s Finance Committee aimed at mitigating public dissatisfaction by dropping several contentious tax proposals. This legislative move coincided with a wave of protests primarily driven by Gen Z and millennials, marking a pivotal moment in the country’s political landscape. Protests erupted across multiple Kenyan cities, including Nairobi and key areas within President William Ruto’s Rift Valley strongholds like Eldoret and Kericho. These demonstrations were notable not only for their scope but also for their organization. They were orchestrated online without the backing of established political parties. The phrase “Tuko wengi,” meaning “We are many,” echoed through the streets of Eldoret, symbolizing the protesters’ unity and significant numbers. The demographic profile of the protesters is particularly noteworthy. Approximately 75% of Kenya’s population is under 35, with a median age of 19. Young Kenyans Mobilize This young populace could be a transformative force in future electoral processes, potentially starting with the 2027 general elections. Their active engagement in these protests reflects a broader trend of increasing political mobilization through digital platforms. This trend facilitates widespread participation and amplifies their collective voice. This series of protests underscores a deep-seated discontent among the youth, who perceive the tax hikes as detrimental to their economic prospects. Their willingness to publicly express their dissatisfaction highlights a shift towards more grassroots political involvement. This suggests that these young, digitally-savvy generations could significantly shape the future of Kenyan politics...\n",

      "📝 Excerpt: Inflation in Kenya: why and how to fix it; Image: Adobe stock Inflation has hit many countries recently, from the United States to Sri Lanka. In Kenya, too, the rising prices of basic commodities have left most citizens wondering what’s going on. The price of a 2kg packet of maize and wheat flour hit 200 shillings (US$2) from a low of 120 shillings in about three months. That is a 67% increase. The 12-month overall inflation rate reached 7.91% in June 2022. Politicians eyeing Kenya’s 9 August polls have been offering solutions in exchange for votes. ADVERTISEMENT Kenya’s average annual per capita income is US$5 270. With inflation, citizens lose even this limited purchasing power. The same money buys less. Wages and salaries do not go up fast enough. Citizens’ discontent can change the way they vote in democratic countries or lead to violence in undemocratic ones. The Kenya African National Union, which ruled the country from independence in 1963, was voted out in 2002 partly because of citizens’ discontent over the state of the economy. And in the US, economic discontent has been a big factor in voting; it led to Donald Trump’s win in the 2016 presidential polls. That’s why politicians are so quick to promise relief. But can they provide it? The two key drivers of inflation in Kenya’s consumer price index are food and energy. Russia’s war on Ukraine has raised the price of oil to the highest level in history, which spills over to the rest of global economy. And about 30% to 50% of Kenya’s imported wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine is exporting 60% less wheat this year compared with 2021, leading to a rise in price of wheat and its derivatives like bread. Unreliable rains have cut domestic production of maize and other food crops in Kenya. Production is about 15% to 20% below the five-year average.

Behind that surge are small business owners and individuals turning to digital assets as a lifeline. They’re navigating the same harsh realities the data confirms: soaring inflation, unpredictable local currencies, and banking systems that have left many behind. To put faces to these numbers, Tether released a short documentary from Kenya. The film highlights local merchants using USDT to pay international suppliers and families relying on it to receive remittances from abroad. It’s a grassroots look at how a global digital dollar is providing a tangible anchor in economies often defined by their volatility....\n",

      "📝 Excerpt: . Production is about 15% to 20% below the five-year average. ADVERTISEMENT Some of the drivers of Kenya’s inflation are local while others are external and beyond its control. My view, based on my analysis of the Kenyan economy and other countries, is that inflation can be managed but there are no quick fixes. ALSO READ: Throwback: Family turns ‘white’ after freak accident (pics) Drivers of inflation In Kenya, a confluence of many factors has inflated prices, particularly after the Ukraine war and the pandemic. One is elections. Lots of money is spent during electioneering. Some of it is just given out with no commensurate productivity. Kenya saw this in 1990, when money in circulation rose before the 1992 elections and so did the rate of inflation. The second factor is corruption and mismanagement. Whether it’s in procurement where prices are inflated, or when goods are not supplied or substandard ones are supplied, consumers pay the price. The cost of corruption to the economy has been put by President Uhuru Kenyatta at 2 billion shillings, translating to about 7% of GDP annually. If people make illegal water or power connections, honest people pay for that. If a tender for building a road is inflated, someone pays for it. If government and its agencies over-employ, someone pays for that. If it takes longer to get services like port clearance and building approvals, someone pays for it. If bribes are exchanged, someone pays for it. The 50-shilling note given to police at a roadblock is paid by someone else. A third driver of inflation is a weak currency. Kenya’s currency has declined by 3.5% since the start of the year, partly because of decisions taken in other countries that affect the value of their currencies. A fourth driver of inflation is tax. It raises the price of goods and services. The Finance Act 2022 brought in new taxes and raised the rates of other existing ones. It seems the government did this to raise money without incurring more debts...\n",

The contentious changes will double the tax on fuel to 16% to generate another 61 billion shillings or a little under 400,000 euros, for the government. The bill still has to be signed by Ruto and opposition members have threatened to call fresh protests if he does. The bill also proposes a new housing levy which Ruto says will help build more affordable houses but many Kenyans hit hard by the rising cost of living say they can't shoulder the extra cost.

      "📝 Excerpt: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 10 — President William Ruto says he has “no regrets” over his directive to police to shoot protesters “in the feet,” defending the use of force during violent anti-government demonstrations last year. Speaking in an interview with Al Jazeera aired on Sunday, Ruto maintained that police acted lawfully when responding to riots that left dozens dead and businesses destroyed. “I don’t regret those comments at all because the law allows the police to use force when other people’s lives are in danger,” he said. When challenged on whether shooting protesters was excessive, he replied, “That is according to you. I think the police know what they need to do.” The President said his administration had to “balance” between allowing peaceful demonstrations and curbing criminal activity during the unrest. “We have had to balance between dealing with violent criminals on one end and managing protests on the other,” he told James Bays. Ruto says police to immobilize vandals, take them to court » Capital News July 9 directive Ruto’s comments referred to a July 9 address in Nairobi’s Kilimani area, where he warned vandals and looters that they would be immobilized and taken to court. “Anybody torching and destroying another person’s business should be shot in the feet and taken to the hospital pending court appearance,” Ruto declared at the time. “We want people to do business. Enough is enough.” The President spoke amid escalating anti-government protests that saw supermarkets and small businesses looted and torched in several towns, including Meru, Kitengela, and Kahawa Sukari. Magunas Supermarket in Meru was among the worst hit — ransacked and later set ablaze. According to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR), thirty-one people were killed in the early wave of protests, with the toll later rising to sixty-five as demonstrations continued through June and July...\n",
